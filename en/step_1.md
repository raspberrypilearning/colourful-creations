## Introduction:
This project introduces dictionaries by creating a dictionary that maps from human-friendly colour names to hex codes. The colour codes are then looked up in the dictionary and used to create a colourful poster. 

## Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ colourful-creations/colourful-creations.py

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Club leader resources' section, which contains:

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives
+ Dictionaries - creating and looking up values;
+ Turtle graphics - text, fonts and colours;

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

+ [Design basic 2D and 3D assets.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/design/creator)

## Challenges
+ More colours! - Use a colour picker website to find hexcodes for more colours and add them to a dictionary. 
+ Create a poster - Create a custom colour palette dictionary and use it to create a poster using Turtle graphics. 

## Frequently Asked Questions
+ Children may need reminding about the comma ',' at the end of each dictionary entry.
