## Challenge: More colours!

Can you add more colours to your dictionary and try them out? Use <a href="http://jumpto.cc/colour-picker" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/colour-picker</a> to find more colours. 

Don't forget to give your colours awesome names. 

Here's some example code to remind you how to use the turtle:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 17
line_highlights: 
---
penup()
goto(0, 100)
color(colours['reallyraspberry'])
style = ('Arial', 40, 'bold')
write('HELLO', font=style, align='center')
right(90)
forward(60)
color(colours['awesomeorange'])
write('WORLD', font=style, align='center')
hideturtle()
